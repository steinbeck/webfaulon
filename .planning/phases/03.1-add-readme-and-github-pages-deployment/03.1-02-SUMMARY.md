# Phase 03.1 Plan 02: Comprehensive README Summary

Comprehensive project documentation for WebFaulon GitHub repository with live demo link, academic citation, and developer onboarding instructions.

## What Was Built

Created a 116-line README.md that serves as the primary documentation for the WebFaulon GitHub repository. The README provides:

1. **Project Overview**: Clear one-line description and prominent live demo link to https://steinbeck.github.io/webfaulon/
2. **Educational Context**: Explanation of what the tool does, who it's for, and how it makes the Faulon 1996 paper's algorithm tangible
3. **Feature List**: Comprehensive list of capabilities (real-time charts, 2D rendering, configurable parameters, presets, responsive design)
4. **Tech Stack**: TypeScript, Vite, Alpine.js, Chart.js, RDKit.js, Web Workers
5. **Development Setup**: Step-by-step instructions for local development (git clone, npm install, npm run dev)
6. **Build Instructions**: Production build and preview commands
7. **Testing Instructions**: Test suite commands
8. **Algorithm Explanation**: How the SA implementation works (initialization, displacement, Wiener Index, Metropolis criterion, cooling)
9. **Academic Citation**: Full BibTeX entry for the Faulon 1996 paper with DOI
10. **License**: MIT License

## Verification Results

All verification criteria passed:

- Line count: 116 lines (requirement: 80+) ✓
- Faulon mentions: 13 (requirement: 2+) ✓
- Demo link present: https://steinbeck.github.io/webfaulon/ ✓
- Dev setup found: `npm install`, `npm run dev` ✓
- Build instructions found: `npm run build` ✓
- DOI present: 10.1021/ci950093o ✓

## Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Create README.md with project documentation
**Status:** Complete
**Commit:** 636db91
**Files:** README.md (created)

Created comprehensive README following the plan specification:
- Title and one-line description
- Prominent "Try It Live" link to GitHub Pages deployment
- About section with 3 paragraphs explaining educational purpose and Faulon paper context
- Features list (7 bullet points covering real-time execution, rendering, configuration, presets, responsive design)
- Tech stack table
- Development setup with git clone + npm commands
- Build instructions
- Test instructions
- "How It Works" explanation (5-point algorithm walkthrough)
- Academic citation with full BibTeX entry
- MIT License section
- Acknowledgments

Writing style: Clear, academic but accessible. No emojis. Suitable for cheminformatics audience.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Success Criteria Met

- [x] README.md exists and is well-formatted markdown
- [x] Demo link points to https://steinbeck.github.io/webfaulon/
- [x] Faulon 1996 paper is properly cited with DOI
- [x] Development setup instructions are accurate (npm install, npm run dev)
- [x] Tech stack matches actual dependencies in package.json

## Outcome

README.md provides a complete introduction to the project for GitHub visitors. The document:
- Gives immediate clarity on what the project is and why it exists
- Links prominently to the live demo
- Provides proper academic attribution
- Enables developers to clone and run locally
- Establishes the educational and research context

The README is production-ready for the public GitHub repository and supports the upcoming GitHub Pages deployment (Plan 03.1-01).

## Self-Check

Verifying SUMMARY claims against repository state:

```bash
[ -f "README.md" ] && echo "FOUND: README.md" || echo "MISSING: README.md"
```
FOUND: README.md

```bash
git log --oneline --all | grep -q "636db91" && echo "FOUND: 636db91" || echo "MISSING: 636db91"
```
FOUND: 636db91

## Self-Check: PASSED

All claimed files and commits verified in repository.
