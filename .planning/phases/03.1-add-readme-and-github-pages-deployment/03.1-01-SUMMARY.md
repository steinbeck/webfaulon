# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 03-visualization-ux
    provides: Complete web application UI with Alpine.js, Chart.js, and RDKit.js integration
provides:
  - Vite production build configured with /webfaulon/ base path for GitHub Pages
  - RDKit.js loads from unpkg CDN in production builds (version pinned to 2025.3.4-1.0.0)
  - GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment on push to main
  - Valid YAML workflow with correct Pages permissions and artifact upload
affects: [deployment, production, github-pages]

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: [github-actions, unpkg-cdn]
  patterns: [github-pages-deployment, cdn-based-dependencies]

key-files:
  created:
    - .github/workflows/deploy.yml
  modified:
    - vite.config.ts
    - index.html

key-decisions:
  - "Use unpkg CDN for RDKit.js in production (node_modules not available in deployed build)"
  - "Pin RDKit version to 2025.3.4-1.0.0 on unpkg to match package.json"
  - "Use official GitHub Pages actions (not deprecated gh-pages branch approach)"
  - "Set base path to /webfaulon/ for GitHub Pages repository subdirectory deployment"

patterns-established:
  - "CDN-based WASM dependencies for production builds"
  - "Vite base path configuration for GitHub Pages deployment"
  - "GitHub Actions workflow with npm ci, build, and Pages artifact upload"

# Phase 03.1 Plan 01: GitHub Pages Deployment Configuration Summary

**Vite configured with /webfaulon/ base path and unpkg CDN RDKit loading; GitHub Actions workflow deploys dist/ to Pages on push to main**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 1 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-15T15:50:04Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-15T15:51:50Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 3

## Accomplishments
- Production build generates correct asset paths with /webfaulon/ base for GitHub Pages subdirectory deployment
- RDKit.js loads from unpkg CDN (2025.3.4-1.0.0) instead of local node_modules, ensuring production availability
- GitHub Actions workflow ready to build and deploy on push to main (requires enabling Pages in repo settings)
- Local development workflow remains unchanged (npm run dev still works)

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Configure Vite base path and fix RDKit script tag for production** - `0eaef0d` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create GitHub Actions workflow for Pages deployment** - `d5ba979` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `vite.config.ts` - Added base: '/webfaulon/' for GitHub Pages deployment
- `index.html` - Replaced local /node_modules/ RDKit script with unpkg CDN URL (version 2025.3.4-1.0.0)
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow for automated Pages deployment

## Decisions Made
- **Unpkg CDN for RDKit:** Production builds cannot access /node_modules/, so RDKit.js must load from CDN. Pinned version to 2025.3.4-1.0.0 to match package.json dependency.
- **Base path /webfaulon/:** GitHub Pages serves repository projects at username.github.io/repo-name/, requiring Vite base configuration.
- **Official GitHub Pages actions:** Used actions/upload-pages-artifact and actions/deploy-pages (modern approach) instead of deprecated gh-pages branch deployment.
- **Node.js 20 in workflow:** Matches development environment and is LTS version.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None - all configuration changes worked as expected on first build.

## User Setup Required

**GitHub Pages must be enabled in repository settings before workflow can deploy:**

1. Go to repository Settings > Pages
2. Set Source to "GitHub Actions"
3. Push this commit to main to trigger first deployment
4. App will be available at https://steinbeck.github.io/webfaulon/

The workflow file includes a comment noting this requirement.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Deployment infrastructure complete
- Ready for README documentation in Plan 02
- No blockers
