# Project State

## Project Reference

**Core value:** Students can see and interact with the SA algorithm exploring constitutional isomer space in real time — making the abstract algorithm from the paper tangible and intuitive.
**Current focus:** v2.0 — Python Backend Architecture

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Carried forward from v1.0:

- RDKit.js set_new_coords() required before draw_to_canvas() (zero-coord crash)
- unpkg CDN for RDKit.js in production (node_modules unavailable in deployed build)
